abstract = {The evolution of the cell-cycle is known to be influenced by environmental conditions, including lack of extracellular oxygen (hypoxia). Notably, hypoxia appears to have different effects on normal and cancer cells. Whereas both experience hypoxia-induced arrest of the G1 phase of the cell-cycle (i.e. delay in the transition through the restriction point), experimental evidence suggests that only cancer cells undergo hypoxia-induced quiescence (i.e. the transition of the cell to a latent state in which most of the cell functions, including proliferation, are suspended). Here, we extend a model for the cell-cycle due to Tyson and Novak (J. Theor. Biol. 210 (2001) 249) to account for the action of the protein p27. This protein, whose expression is upregulated under hypoxia, inhibits the activation of the cyclin dependent kinases (CDKs), thus preventing DNA synthesis and delaying the normal progression through the cell-cycle. We use a combination of numerical and analytic techniques to study our model. We show that it reproduces many features of the response to hypoxia of normal and cancer cells, as well as generating experimentally testable predictions. For example our model predicts that cancer cells can undergo quiescence by increasing their levels of p27, whereas for normal cells p27 expression decreases when the cellular growth rate increases. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Hypoxia is known to influence the cell cycle by increasing the G1 phase duration or by inducing a quiescent state (arrest of cell proliferation). This entry into quiescence is a mean for the cell to escape from hypoxia-induced apoptosis. It is suggested that some cancer cells have gain the advantage over normal cells to easily enter into quiescence when environmental conditions, such as oxygen pressure, are unfavorable [43,1]. This ability contributes in the appearance of highly resistant and aggressive tumor phenotypes [2].The HiF-1$\alpha$ factor is the key actor of the intracellular hypoxia pathway. As tumor cells undergo chronic hypoxic conditions, HiF-1$\alpha$ is present in higher level in cancer than in normal cells. Besides, it was shown that genetic mutations promoting overstabilization of HiF-1$\alpha$ are a feature of various types of cancers [7]. Finally, it is suggested that the intracellular level of HiF-1$\alpha$ can be related to the aggressiveness of the tumors [53,24,4,10]. However, up to now, mathematical models describing the G1/S transition under hypoxia, did not take into account the HiF-1$\alpha$ factor in the hypoxia pathway. Therefore, we propose a mathematical model of the G1/S transition under hypoxia, which explicitly integrates the HiF-1$\alpha$ pathway. The model reproduces the slowing down of G1 phase under moderate hypoxia, and the entry into quiescence of proliferating cells under severe hypoxia. We show how the inhibition of cyclin D by HiF-1$\alpha$ can induce quiescence; this result provides a theoretical explanation to the experimental observations of Wen et al. (2010) [50]. Thus, our model confirms that hypoxia-induced chemoresistance can be linked, for a part, to the negative regulation of cyclin D by HiF-1$\alpha$. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Cyclin G2, together with cyclin G1 and cyclin I, defines a novel cyclin family expressed in terminally differentiated tissues including brain and muscle. Cyclin G2 expression is up-regulated as cells undergo cell cycle arrest or apoptosis in response to inhibitory stimuli independent of p53 (Horne, M., Donaldson, K., Goolsby, G., Tran, D., Mulheisen, M., Hell, J. and Wahl, A. (1997) J. Biol. Chem. 272, 12650-12661). We tested the hypothesis that cyclin G2 may be a negative regulator of cell cycle progression and found that ectopic expression of cyclin G2 induces the formation of aberrant nuclei and cell cycle arrest in HEK293 and Chinese hamster ovary cells. Cyclin G2 is primarily partitioned to a detergent-resistant compartment, suggesting an association with cytoskeletal elements. We determined that cyclin G2 and its homolog cyclin G1 directly interact with the catalytic subunit of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A). An okadaic acid-sensitive (<2 nM) phosphatase activity coprecipitates with endogenous and ectopic cyclin G2. We found that cyclin G2 also associates with various PP2A B′ regulatory subunits, as previously shown for cyclin G1. The PP2A/A subunit is not detectable in cyclin G2-PP2A-B′-C complexes. Notably, cyclin G2 colocalizes with both PP2A/C and B′ subunits in detergent-resistant cellular compartments, suggesting that these complexes form in living cells. The ability of cyclin G2 to inhibit cell cycle progression correlates with its ability to bind PP2A/B′ and C subunits. Together, our findings suggest that cyclin G2-PP2A complexes inhibit cell cycle progression.},

abstract = {Intracellular pH (pH(i)) regulation was studied in acid-loaded barnacle muscle fibers by monitoring recovery of pH(i) with a pH-sensitive microelectrode. By multiplying the rate of pH(i) recovery by total intracellular buffering power, the acid extrusion rate was obtained. The acid extrusion rate was greatest at low values of pH(i), and declined toward zero as pH(i) approached normal levels. It increased as the extracellular pH (pH0) was raised either by increasing external [HCO3-] ([HCO3-]0) at constant P(CO2) or by decreasing P(CO2) at constant [HCO3-[0, but more so in the former case than in the latter. These observations suggest that pH0 per se is an important determinant of the acid extrusion rate, but that raising [HCO3-[0 by itself also stimulates acid extrusion. This would be expected if acid extrusion involves the inward movement of HCO3-. When fibers were exposed to HCO3-containing solutions at very low or very high pH0, pH(i) drifted downward or upward, respectively; these drifts were inhibited by 4-acetamido-4' isothiocyanostilbene-2,2' disulfonic acid (SITS). Our results are discussed in terms of possible mechanisms of acid extrusion.},

CDRscan employs a two-step convolution architecture, where the genomic mutational fingerprints of cell lines and the molecular fingerprints of drugs are processed individually, then merged by 'virtual docking', an in silico modelling of drug treatment. Analysis of the goodness-of-fit between observed and predicted drug response revealed a high prediction accuracy of CDRscan (R2 > 0.84; AUROC > 0.98). We applied CDRscan to 1,487 approved drugs and identified 14 oncology and 23 non-oncology drugs having new potential cancer indications. This, to our knowledge, is the first-time application of a deep learning model in predicting the feasibility of drug repurposing. By further clinical validation, CDRscan is expected to allow selection of the most effective anticancer drugs for the genomic profile of the individual patient.},

abstract = {Cancer cells have been shown to have altered metabolism when compared to normal non-malignant cells. The Warburg effect describes a phenomenon in which cancer cells preferentially metabolize glucose by glycolysis, producing lactate as an end product, despite being the presence of oxygen. The phenomenon was first described by Otto Warburg in the 1920s, and has resurfaced as a controversial theory, with both supportive and opposing arguments. The biochemical aspects of the Warburg effect outline a strong explanation for the cause of cancer cell proliferation, by providing the biological requirements for a cell to grow. Studies have shown that pathways such as phosphoinositide 3-kinase/protein kinase B/mammalian target of rapamycin (PI3K/Akt/mTOR) as well as hypoxia inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) are central regulators of glycolysis, cancer metabolism and cancer cell proliferation. Studies have shown that PI3K signaling pathways have a role in many cellular processes such as metabolism, inflammation, cell survival, motility and cancer progression. Herein, the cellular aspects of the PI3K pathway are described, as well as the influence HIF has on cancer cell metabolism. HIF-1 activation has been related to angiogenesis, erythropoiesis and modulation of key enzymes involved in aerobic glycolysis, thereby modulating key processes required for the Warburg effect. In this review we discuss the molecular aspects of the Warburg effect with a particular emphasis on the role of the HIF-1 and the PI3K pathway.},

We hypothesize that the poor metabolic conditions near the ductal center foment the emergence of a Warburg Effect (WE) phenotype, wherein cells rapidly ferment glucose to lactic acid, even in normoxia. To test this hypothesis, we subjected pre-malignant breast cancer cells to different microenvironmental selection pressures using combinations of hypoxia, acidosis, low glucose, and starvation for many months, and isolated single clones for metabolic and transcriptomic profiling. The two harshest conditions selected for constitutively expressed WE phenotypes. RNA-seq analysis of WE clones identified the transcription factors NFkB and KLF4 as potential inducers of the WE phenotype. NFkB was highly phosphorylated in the glycolytic clones. In stained DCIS samples, KLF4 expression was enriched in the area with the harshest microenvironmental conditions. We simulated in vivo DCIS phenotypic evolution using a mathematical model calibrated from the in vitro results. The WE phenotype emerged in the poor metabolic conditions near the necrotic core. We propose that harsh microenvironments within DCIS select for a Warburg phenotype through constitutive transcriptional reprogramming, thus conferring a survival advantage and facilitating further growth and invasion.},

Currently, the best that can be offered is a modest 14-month overall median survival in patients undergoing maximum safe resection plus adjuvant chemoradiotherapy. Prognostic factors involved in survival include age, performance status, grade, specific markers (MGMT methylation, mutation of IDH1, IDH2 or TERT, 1p19q codeletion, overexpression of EGFR, etc.) and, likely, the extent of resection. Certain adjuncts to surgery, especially cortical mapping and 5-ALA fluorescence, favor higher rates of gross total resection with apparent positive impact on survival. Recurrent tumors can be offered re-intervention, participation in clinical trials, anti-angiogenic agent or local electric field therapy, without an evident impact on survival. Molecular-targeted therapies, immunotherapy and gene therapy are promising tools currently under research.},

To understand how CycD/Cdk4 promotes growth, we performed a screen for modifiers of CycD/Cdk4-driven overgrowth in the eye. Loss-of-function mutations in Hif-1 prolyl hydroxylase (Hph), an enzyme involved in the cellular response to hypoxic stress, dominantly suppress the growth but not the proliferation function of CycD/Cdk4. hph mutant cells are defective for growth, and, remarkably, ectopic expression of Hph is sufficient to increase cellular growth. Epistasis analysis places Hph downstream of CycD/Cdk4. Overexpressed CycD/Cdk4 causes an increase in Hph protein in tissues where Hph induces growth, suggesting a mechanism whereby Hph levels are regulated posttranscriptionally in response to CycD/Cdk4. Our data suggest that Hph, in addition to its function in hypoxic response, is a regulator of cellular growth and that it is a key mediator for CycD/Cdk4.},

abstract = {Many multicellular systems problems can only be understood by studying how cells move, grow, divide, interact, and die. Tissue-scale dynamics emerge from systems of many interacting cells as they respond to and influence their microenvironment. The ideal “virtual laboratory” for such multicellular systems simulates both the biochemical microenvironment (the “stage”) and many mechanically and biochemically interacting cells (the “players” upon the stage). PhysiCell—physics-based multicellular simulator—is an open source agent-based simulator that provides both the stage and the players for studying many interacting cells in dynamic tissue microenvironments. It builds upon a multi-substrate biotransport solver to link cell phenotype to multiple diffusing substrates and signaling factors. It includes biologically-driven sub-models for cell cycling, apoptosis, necrosis, solid and fluid volume changes, mechanics, and motility “out of the box.” The C++ code has minimal dependencies, making it simple to maintain and deploy across platforms. PhysiCell has been parallelized with OpenMP, and its performance scales linearly with the number of cells. Simulations up to 105-106 cells are feasible on quad-core desktop workstations; larger simulations are attainable on single HPC compute nodes. We demonstrate PhysiCell by simulating the impact of necrotic core biomechanics, 3-D geometry, and stochasticity on the dynamics of hanging drop tumor spheroids and ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) of the breast. We demonstrate stochastic motility, chemical and contact-based interaction of multiple cell types, and the extensibility of PhysiCell with examples in synthetic multicellular systems (a “cellular cargo delivery” system, with application to anti-cancer treatments), cancer heterogeneity, and cancer immunology. PhysiCell is a powerful multicellular systems simulator that will be continually improved with new capabilities and performance improvements. It also represents a significant independent code base for replicating results from other simulation platforms. The PhysiCell source code, examples, documentation, and support are available under the BSD license at http://PhysiCell.MathCancer.org and http://PhysiCell.sf.net.},

abstract = {Cells in a low oxygen, or hypoxic, microenvironment must have the ability to sense oxygen levels in the nucleus in order to maintain oxygen homeostasis by gene regulation. Hypoxia inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) serves as a molecular bridge between the sensation and utilization of oxygen, and thus functions as a key player in oxygen homeostasis. HIF-1 is a heterodimeric transcription factor and is composed of two subunits, the oxygen-sensitive HIF-1$\alpha$ and constitutively expressed HIF-1$\beta$. HIF-1 regulates the expression of a broad range of genes that facilitate acclimation to low oxygen conditions by changes in protein levels in circulation, metabolism, and proliferation. Appropriate temporal and spatial activation of HIF-1 is crucial not only in developmental and physiological processes, characterized by programmed cellular proliferation, but also in pathophysiological conditions such as tumorigenesis, which exhibit unregulated cellular proliferation. However, many contradictory reports as to the role of HIF-1 in the regulation of cellular proliferation have been put forward in recent years. In this review, our first aim is to summarize the current knowledge of oxygen-dependent HIF-1 activation mechanisms based on its structure. Then we will describe the proposed mechanisms through which HIF-1 regulates cellular proliferation of different cell types, including tumor cells as well as non-transformed, nonimmortalized cells under normoxic and hypoxic conditions.},

Indeed, hypoxia benefits cancer cells in their growth, survival, and metastasis. The historical discovery of hypoxia-inducible factor-1$\alpha$ (HIF1A) in the early 1990s had a great influence on the field as many phenomena in hypoxia could be explained by HIF1A. However, not all regions or types of tumors are necessarily hypoxic. Thus, it is difficult to explain whole cancer pathobiology by hypoxia, especially in the early stage of cancer. Upregulation of glucose metabolism in cancer cells has been well known. Oxygen-independent glycolysis is activated in cancer cells even in the normoxia condition, which is known as the Warburg effect. Accumulating evidence and recent advances in cancer metabolism research suggest that hypoxia-independent mechanisms for HIF signaling activation is a hallmark for cancer. There are various mechanisms that generate pseudohypoxic conditions, even in normoxia. Given the importance of HIF1A for cancer pathobiology, the pseudohypoxia concept could shed light on the longstanding mystery of the Warburg effect and accelerate better understanding of the diverse phenomena seen in a variety of cancers.},

abstract = {Thyroid cancer is the most common sort of endocrine-related cancer with more prevalent in women and elderly individuals which has quickly widespread expansion in worldwide over the recent decades. Common features of malignant thyroid cells are to have accelerated metabolism and increased glucose uptake to optimize their energy supply which provides a fundamental advantage for growth. In tumor cells the retaining of required energy charge for cell survival is imperative, indeed glucose transporters are enable of promoting of this task. According to this relation it has been reported the upregulation of glucose transporters in various types of cancers. Human studies indicated that poor survival can be occurred following the high levels of GLUT1 expression in tumors. GLUT-1 and GLUT3 are the glucose transporters which seems to be mainly engaged with the oncogenesis of thyroid cancer and their expression in malignant tissues is much more than in the normal one. They are promising targets for the advancement of anticancer strategies. The lack of oncosuppressors have dominant effect on the membrane expression of GLUT1 and glucose uptake. Overexpression of hypoxia inducible factors have been additionally connected with distant metastasis in thyroid cancers which mediates transcriptional regulation of glycolytic genes including GLUT1 and GLUT3. Though the physiological role of the thyroid gland is well illustrated, but the metabolic regulations in thyroid cancer remain evasive. In this study we discuss proliferation pathways of the key regulators and signaling molecules such as PI3K-Akt, HIF-1, MicroRNA, PTEN, AMPK, BRAF, c-Myc, TSH, Iodide and p53 which includes in the regulation of GLUTs in thyroid cancer cells. Incidence of deregulations in cellular energetics and metabolism are the most serious signs of cancers. In conclusion, understanding the mechanisms of glucose transportation in normal and pathologic thyroid tissues is critically important and could provide significant insights in science of diagnosis and treatment of thyroid disease.

This additional proton efflux exacerbates extracellular acidification and supports the formation of a hostile environment. In the present study we propose a novel, data-based model for this proton-coupled lactate transport in cancer cells. The mathematical settings involve systems coupling nonlinear ordinary and stochastic differential equations describing the dynamics of intra- and extracellular proton and lactate concentrations. The data involve time series of intracellular proton concentrations of normoxic and hypoxic MCF-7 breast cancer cells. The good agreement of our final model with the data suggests the existence of proton pools near the cell membrane, which can be controlled by intracellular and extracellular carbonic anhydrases to drive proton-coupled lactate transport across the plasma membrane of hypoxic cancer cells.},

One of the key cell-autonomous effects of hypoxia is as a modulator of cell proliferation.

However, certain cell populations maintain cell proliferation in the face of hypoxia. This is a common pathological hallmark of cancers, but can also serve a physiological function, as in the maintenance of stem cell populations that reside in a hypoxic niche.

abstract = {Acid-extrusion by active transport is important in metabolically active cancer cells, where it removes excess intracellular acid and sets the intracellular resting pH. Hypoxia is a major trigger of adaptive responses in cancer, but its effect on acid-extrusion remains unclear. We studied pH-regulation under normoxia and hypoxia in eight cancer cell-lines (HCT116, RT112, MDA-MB-468, MCF10A, HT29, HT1080, MiaPaca2, HeLa) using the pH-sensitive fluorophore, cSNARF-1. Hypoxia responses were triggered by pre-incubation in low O2 or with the 2-oxoglutarate-dependent dioxygenase inhibitor dimethyloxalylglycine (DMOG). By selective pharmacological inhibition or transport-substrate removal, acid-extrusion flux was dissected into components due to Na+/H+ exchange (NHE) and Na+-dependent HCO3- transport. In half of the cell-lines (HCT116, RT112, MDA-MB-468, MCF10A), acid-extrusion on NHE was the dominant flux during an acid load, and in all of these, bar one (MDA-MB-468), NHE-flux was reduced following hypoxic incubation. Further studies in HCT116 cells showed that <4-h hypoxic incubation reduced NHE-flux reversibly with a time-constant of 1-2h. This was not associated with a change in expression of NHE1, the principal NHE isoform. Following 48-h hypoxia, inhibition of NHE-flux persisted but became only slowly reversible and associated with reduced expression of the glycosylated form of NHE1. Acid-extrusion by Na+-dependent HCO3- transport was hypoxia-insensitive and comparable in all cell lines. This constitutive and stable element of pH-regulation was found to be important for setting and stabilizing resting pH at a mildly alkaline level (conducive for growth), irrespective of oxygenation status. In contrast, the more variable flux on NHE underlies cell-specific differences in their dynamic response to larger acid loads. {\textcopyright} 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

Monocarboxylate transporters (MCTs) are reported to transport L-lactate, which is important for CNS physiology and cognitive function. However, it remains unclear which MCT isoform is functionally expressed by human astrocytes. The aim of this study was to establish the contribution of each MCT isoform to L-lactate transport in human astrocytes. Methods The function of L-lactate transport was studied using NHA cells as a human astrocyte model and radiolabeled L-lactate. The expression of MCT in human astrocytes was detected by immunohistochemistry staining. Results The cellular uptake of L-lactate was found to be pH- and concentration-dependent with a Km value for L-lactate uptake of 0.64 mM. This Km was similar to what has been previously established for MCT1-mediated L-lactate uptake. $\alpha$-Cyano-4- hydroxycinnamate (CHC) and 5-oxoproline, which are both MCT1 inhibitors, were found to significantly inhibit the uptake of L-lactate, suggesting MCT1 is primarily responsible for L-lactate transport. Moreover, MCT1 protein was expressed in human astrocytes. Conclusion pH-dependent L-lactate transport is mediated by MCT1 in human astrocytes.},

As the cost of developing a new drug remains prohibitively expensive, repurposing of existing approved and investigational drugs is sought after given known safety profiles and reduction in the cost barrier. Notably, successes in oncologic drug repurposing have been infrequent. Computational in-silico strategies have been developed to aid in modeling biological processes to find new disease-relevant targets and discovering novel drug-target and drug-phenotype associations.

abstract = {Over the past century, treatment of malignant tumors of the brain has remained a challenge. Refinements in neurosurgical techniques, discovery of powerful chemotherapeutic agents, advances in radiotherapy, applications of biotechnology, and improvements in methods of targeted delivery have led to some extension of length of survival of glioblastoma patients. Refinements in surgery are mentioned because most of the patients with glioblastoma undergo surgery and many of the other innovative therapies are combined with surgery. However, cure of glioblastoma has remained elusive because it requires complete destruction of the tumor. Radical surgical ablation is not possible in the brain and even a small residual tumor leads to rapid recurrence that eventually kills the patient. Blood-brain barrier (BBB) comprising brain endothelial cells lining the cerebral microvasculature, limits delivery of drugs to the brain. Even though opening of the BBB in tumor core occurs locally, BBB limits systemic chemotherapy especially at the tumor periphery, where tumor cells invade normal brain structure comprising intact BBB. Comprehensive approaches are necessary to gain maximally from promising targeted therapies. Common methods used for critical evaluation of targeted therapies for glioblastoma include: (1) novel methods for targeted delivery of chemotherapy; (2) strategies for delivery through BBB and blood-tumor barriers; (3) innovations in radiotherapy for selective destruction of tumor; (4) techniques for local destruction of tumor; (5) tumor growth inhibitors; (6) immunotherapy; and (7) cell/gene therapies. Suggestions for improvements in glioblastoma therapy include: (1) controlled targeted delivery of anticancer therapy to glioblastoma through the BBB using nanoparticles and monoclonal antibodies; (2) direct introduction of genetically modified bacteria that selectively destroy cancer cells but spare the normal brain into the remaining tumor after resection; (3) use of better animal models for preclinical testing; and (4) personalized/precision medicine approaches to therapy in clinical trials and translation into practice of neurosurgery and neurooncology. Advances in these techniques suggest optimism for the future management of glioblastoma.},

abstract = {Metabolic plasticity enables cancer cells to switch their metabolism phenotypes between glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) during tumorigenesis and metastasis. However, it is still largely unknown how cancer cells orchestrate gene regulation to balance their glycolysis and OXPHOS activities. Previously, by modeling the gene regulation of cancer metabolism we have reported that cancer cells can acquire a stable hybrid metabolic state in which both glycolysis and OXPHOS can be used. Here, to comprehensively characterize cancer metabolic activity, we establish a theoretical framework by coupling gene regulation with metabolic pathways. Our modeling results demonstrate a direct association between the activities of AMPK and HIF-1, master regulators of OXPHOS and glycolysis, respectively, with the activities of three major metabolic pathways: glucose oxidation, glycolysis, and fatty acid oxidation. Our model further characterizes the hybrid metabolic state and a metabolically inactive state where cells have low activity of both glycolysis and OXPHOS. We verify the model prediction using metabolomics and transcriptomics data from paired tumor and adjacent benign tissue samples from a cohort of breast cancer patients and RNA-sequencing data from The Cancer Genome Atlas. We further validate the model prediction by in vitro studies of aggressive triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells. The experimental results confirm that TNBC cells can maintain a hybrid metabolic phenotype and targeting both glycolysis and OXPHOS is necessary to eliminate their metabolic plasticity. In summary, our work serves as a platform to symmetrically study how tuning gene activity modulates metabolic pathway activity, and vice versa.},

abstract = {Muscle lactate transport was studied in rat sarcolemmal giant vesicles, in which the membrane orientation was similar to that of intact cells. The lactate concentration dependency was studied using influx and efflux experiments under equilibrium exchange, zero-trans, and infinite-cis conditions. At constant external and internal pH the carrier behaved symmetrically with regard to lactate transport from the two sides of the membrane. Lactate at the trans side stimulated the lactate tracer-flux (trans-acceleration). Both in zero-trans influx and efflux experiments the lactate flux was stimulated in a symmetric way by H+ at the cis side, consistent with protons being the substrate for the carrier. In contrast, the lactate flux was symmetrically inhibited by H+ at the trans side (trans-inhibition), the underlying mechanism is likely that the protonated carrier with no lactate bound is unable to reorient in the membrane. These findings have implications both for the kinetic model and for understanding the physiological function of the lactate/proton transporter.},

abstract = {Mathematical modeling is a key process to describe the behavior of biological networks. One of the most difficult challenges is to build models that allow quantitative predictions of the cells' states along time. Recently, this issue started to be tackled through novel in silico approaches, such as the reconstruction of dynamic models, the use of phenotype prediction methods, and pathway design via efficient strain optimization algorithms. The use of dynamic models, which include detailed kinetic information of the biological systems, potentially increases the scope of the applications and the accuracy of the phenotype predictions. New efforts in metabolic engineering aim at bridging the gap between this approach and other different paradigms of mathematical modeling, as constraint-based approaches. These strategies take advantage of the best features of each method, and deal with the most remarkable limitation - the lack of available experimental information - which affects the accuracy and feasibility of solutions. Parameter estimation helps to solve this problem, but adding more computational cost to the overall process. Moreover, the existing approaches include limitations such as their scalability, flexibility, convergence time of the simulations, among others. The aim is to establish a trade-off between the size of the model and the level of accuracy of the solutions. In this work, we review the state of the art of dynamic modeling and related methods used for metabolic engineering applications, including approaches based on hybrid modeling. We describe approaches developed to undertake issues regarding the mathematical formulation and the underlying optimization algorithms, and that address the phenotype prediction by including available kinetic rate laws of metabolic processes. Then, we discuss how these have been used and combined as the basis to build computational strain optimization methods for metabolic engineering purposes, how they lead to bi-level schemes that can be used in the industry, and their limitations are also considered.},

abstract = {Machine learning methods have been applied to many data sets in pharmaceutical research for several decades. The relative ease and availability of fingerprint type molecular descriptors paired with Bayesian methods resulted in the widespread use of this approach for a diverse array of end points relevant to drug discovery. Deep learning is the latest machine learning algorithm attracting attention for many of pharmaceutical applications from docking to virtual screening. Deep learning is based on an artificial neural network with multiple hidden layers and has found considerable traction for many artificial intelligence applications. We have previously suggested the need for a comparison of different machine learning methods with deep learning across an array of varying data sets that is applicable to pharmaceutical research. End points relevant to pharmaceutical research include absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity (ADME/Tox) properties, as well as activity against pathogens and drug discovery data sets. In this study, we have used data sets for solubility, probe-likeness, hERG, KCNQ1, bubonic plague, Chagas, tuberculosis, and malaria to compare different machine learning methods using FCFP6 fingerprints. These data sets represent whole cell screens, individual proteins, physicochemical properties as well as a data set with a complex end point. Our aim was to assess whether deep learning offered any improvement in testing when assessed using an array of metrics including AUC, F1 score, Cohen's kappa, Matthews correlation coefficient and others. Based on ranked normalized scores for the metrics or data sets Deep Neural Networks (DNN) ranked higher than SVM, which in turn was ranked higher than all the other machine learning methods. Visualizing these properties for training and test sets using radar type plots indicates when models are inferior or perhaps over trained. These results also suggest the need for assessing deep learning further using multiple metrics with much larger scale comparisons, prospective testing as well as assessment of different fingerprints and DNN architectures beyond those used.},

Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) is an ubiquitously used tool for evaluating pathway enrichment in transcriptional data. Typical experimental design consists in comparing two conditions with several replicates using a differential gene expression test followed by preranked GSEA performed against a collection of hundreds and thousands of pathways. However, the reference implementation of this method cannot accurately estimate small P-values, which significantly limits its sensitivity due to multiple hypotheses correction procedure.

Here we present FGSEA (Fast Gene Set Enrichment Analysis) method that is able to estimate arbitrarily low GSEA P-values with a high accuracy in a matter of minutes or even seconds. To confirm the accuracy of the method, we also developed an exact algorithm for GSEA P-values calculation for integer gene-level statistics. Using the exact algorithm as a reference we show that FGSEA is able to routinely estimate P-values up to 10−100 with a small and predictable estimation error. We systematically evaluate FGSEA on a collection of 605 datasets and show that FGSEA recovers much more statistically significant pathways compared to other implementations.

FGSEA is open source and available as an R package in Bioconductor (http://bioconductor.org/packages/fgsea/) and on GitHub (https://github.com/ctlab/fgsea/).

abstract = {Hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF-1) is an oxygen-dependent transcriptional activator, which plays crucial roles in the angiogenesis of tumors and mammalian development. HIF-1 consists of a constitutively expressed HIF-1$\beta$ subunit and one of three subunits (HIF-1$\alpha$, HIF-2$\alpha$ or HIF-3$\alpha$). The stability and activity of HIF-1$\alpha$ are regulated by various post-translational modifications, hydroxylation, acetylation, and phosphorylation. Therefore, HIF-1$\alpha$ interacts with several protein factors including PHD, pVHL, ARD-1, and p300/CBP. Under normoxia, the HIF-1$\alpha$ subunit is rapidly degraded via the von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor gene product (pVHL)- mediated ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. The association of pVHL and HIF-1$\alpha$ under normoxic conditions is triggered by the hydroxylation of prolines and the acetylation of lysine within a polypeptide segment known as the oxygen-dependent degradation (ODD) domain. On the contrary, in the hypoxia condition, HIF-1$\alpha$ subunit becomes stable and interacts with coactivators such as p300/CBP to modulate its transcriptional activity. Eventually, HIF-1 acts as a master regulator of numerous hypoxia-inducible genes under hypoxic conditions. The target genes of HIF-1 are especially related to angiogenesis, cell proliferation/survival, and glucose/iron metabolism. Moreover, it was reported that the activation of HIF-1$\alpha$ is closely associated with a variety of tumors and oncogenic pathways. Hence, the blocking of HIF-1a itself or HIF-1$\alpha$ interacting proteins inhibit tumor growth. Based on these findings, HIF-1 can be a prime target for anticancer therapies. This review summarizes the molecular mechanism of HIF-1a stability, the biological functions of HIF-1 and its potential applications of cancer therapies.},

abstract = {Molecular oxygen (O2) sustains intracellular bioenergetics and is consumed by numerous biochemical reactions, making it essential for most species on Earth. Accordingly, decreased oxygen concentration (hypoxia) is a major stressor that generally subverts life of aerobic species and is a prominent feature of pathological states encountered in bacterial infection, inflammation, wounds, cardiovascular defects and cancer. Therefore, key adaptive mechanisms to cope with hypoxia have evolved in mammals. Systemically, these adaptations include increased ventilation, cardiac output, blood vessel growth and circulating red blood cell numbers. On a cellular level, ATP-consuming reactions are suppressed, and metabolism is altered until oxygen homeostasis is restored. A critical question is how mammalian cells sense oxygen levels to coordinate diverse biological outputs during hypoxia. The best-studied mechanism of response to hypoxia involves hypoxia inducible factors (HIFs), which are stabilized by low oxygen availability and control the expression of a multitude of genes, including those involved in cell survival, angiogenesis, glycolysis and invasion/metastasis. Importantly, changes in oxygen can also be sensed via other stress pathways as well as changes in metabolite levels and the generation of reactive oxygen species by mitochondria. Collectively, this leads to cellular adaptations of protein synthesis, energy metabolism, mitochondrial respiration, lipid and carbon metabolism as well as nutrient acquisition. These mechanisms are integral inputs into fine-tuning the responses to hypoxic stress.},

abstract = {Background: A high rate of glycolysis leading to elevated lactate content has been linked to poor clinical outcomes in patients with head and neck and cervical cancer treated with radiotherapy. Although the biological explanation for this relationship between lactate and treatment response remains unclear, there is a continued interest in evaluating strategies of targeting metabolism to enhance the effectiveness of radiotherapy. The goal of this study was to investigate the effect of metabolic-targeting through HIF-1$\alpha$ inhibition and the associated changes in glycolysis, oxygen consumption and response on the efficacy of high-dose single-fraction radiotherapy (HD-SFRT). Methods: HIF-1$\alpha$ wild-type and HIF-1$\alpha$ knockdown FaDu and ME180 xenograft tumors were grown in the hind leg of mice that were placed in an environmental chamber and exposed to different oxygen conditions (air-breathing and hypoxia). Ex vivo bioluminescence microscopy was used to measure lactate and ATP levels and the hypoxic fraction was measured using EF5 immunohistochemical staining. The oxygen consumption rate (OCR) in each cell line in response to in vitro hypoxia was measured using an extracellular flux analyzer. Tumor growth delay in vivo was measured following HD-SFRT irradiation of 20 Gy. Results: Targeting HIF-1$\alpha$ reduced lactate content, and increased both oxygen consumption and hypoxic fraction in these tumors after exposure to short-term continuous hypoxia. Tumors with intact HIF-1$\alpha$ subjected to HD-SFRT immediately following hypoxia exposure were less responsive to treatment than tumors without functional HIF-1$\alpha$, and tumors irradiated under air breathing conditions regardless of HIF-1$\alpha$ status. Conclusions: Blocking the HIF1 response during transient hypoxic stress increased hypoxia, reduced lactate levels and enhanced response to HD-SFRT. This strategy of combining hypofractionated radiotherapy with metabolic reprogramming to inhibit anaerobic metabolism may increase the efficacy of HD-SFRT through increased oxygen consumption and complementary killing of radiosensitive and hypoxic, radioresistant cells.},

abstract = {Na+/H+ exchanger 1 (NHE1) plays a vital role in the oncogenesis and development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and has been regarded as a promising target for the treatment of HCC. Ginsenoside Rg3 (Rg3), a bioactive ginseng compound, is suggested to possess pleiotropic antitumor effects on HCC. However, the underlying mechanisms of Rg3 suppressing HCC remain unclear. In the present study, we uncovered a novel antitumor mechanism of Rg3 on HCC by decreasing NHE1 expression through in vivo and in vitro studies. Mechanistically, we demonstrated that epidermal growth factor (EGF) could dramatically upregulate NHE1 expression, while increasing the phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase (ERK1/2) level and hypoxia-inducible factor 1 alpha (HIF-1$\alpha$) expression. In the presence of ERK1/2-specific inhibitor PD98059, EGF stimulated HIF-1$\alpha$ and NHE1 expression was obviously blocked in addition, the presence of HIF-1$\alpha$-specific inhibitor 2-methoxyestradiol (2-MeOE2) blocked EGF stimulated NHE1 expression. Moreover, results from in vivo and in vitro studies indicate that Rg3 treatment markedly decreased the expression of EGF, EGF receptor (EGFR), phosphorylated ERK1/2 and HIF-1$\alpha$. Conclusively, these findings suggested that NHE1 was stimulated by EGF, and Rg3 could decrease NHE1 expression by integrally inhibiting EGF-EGFR-ERK1/2-HIF-$\alpha$ signal axis in HCC. Together, our evidence indicated that Rg3 was an effective multi-targets antitumor agent for the treatment of HCC.},

abstract = {Cell fate decisions during embryonic development and tumorigenesis pose a major research challenge in modern developmental and cancer biology. Binary cell fate decisions are usually regulated by gene circuits incorporating either classical toggle switches with two mutually inhibiting transcription factor (TF) genes or chimera toggle switches with a mutually inhibiting pair of microRNA (miRNA) and TF gene. These circuits can explain binary cell fate decisions. Importantly, intermediate cell types can exist during the differentiation of both stem cells and cancer cells. It has been shown that TF-TF self-activating toggle switches (SATS) can have coexistence of three metastable states (tristability), yet the role of chimera toggle switches in opening these additional states remains elusive. Here we present a generalized framework for both the TF-TF SATS and miRNA-TF chimera SATS, starting from the TF-promoter and miRNA-mRNA binding/unbinding dynamics. We show that the chimera SATSs can also have tristability. We demonstrate that the dynamics of miRNA-TF SATS is qualitatively different from that of the TF-TF SATS because the nonlinear effects of translational silencing by miRNA are distinct from those of transcriptional repression. We discuss the possible relevance of these findings to fate decisions by cancer cells. {\textcopyright} 2013 American Chemical Society.},

abstract = {To develop new and more efficient anti-cancer strategies it will be important to characterize the products of transcription factor activity essential for tumorigenesis. One such factor is hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha (HIF-1alpha), a transcription factor induced by low oxygen conditions and found in high levels in malignant solid tumors, but not in normal tissues or slow-growing tumors. In fast-growing tumors, HIF-1alpha is involved in the activation of numerous cellular processes including resistance against apoptosis, over-expression of drug efflux membrane pumps, vascular remodeling and angiogenesis as well as metastasis. In cancer cells, HIF-1alpha induces over-expression and increased activity of several glycolytic protein isoforms that differ from those found in non-malignant cells, including transporters (GLUT1, GLUT3) and enzymes (HKI, HKII, PFK-L, ALD-A, ALD-C, PGK1, ENO-alpha, PYK-M2, LDH-A, PFKFB-3). The enhanced tumor glycolytic flux triggered by HIF-1alpha also involves changes in the kinetic patterns of expressed isoforms of key glycolytic enzymes. The HIF-1alpha induced isoforms provide cancer cells with reduced sensitivity to physiological inhibitors, lower affinity for products and higher catalytic capacity (Vmax(f)) in forward reactions because of marked over-expression compared to those isoforms expressed in normal tissues. Some of the HIF1alpha-induced glycolytic isoforms also participate in survival pathways, including transcriptional activation of H2B histone (by LDH-A), inhibition of apoptosis (by HKII) and promotion of cell migration (by ENO-alpha). HIF-1alpha action may also modulate mitochondrial function and oxygen consumption by inactivating the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex in some tumor types, or by modulating cytochrome c oxidase subunit 4 expression to increase oxidative phosphorylation in other cancer cell lines. In this review, the roles of HIF-1alpha and HIF1alpha-induced glycolytic enzymes are examined and it is concluded that targeting the HIF1alpha-induced glucose transporter and hexokinase, important to glycolytic flux control, might provide better therapeutic targets for inhibiting tumor growth and progression than targeting HIF1alpha itself.},

abstract = {Hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) has been recognized as an important cancer drug target. Many recent studies have provided convincing evidences of strong correlation between elevated levels of HIF-1 and tumor metastasis, angiogenesis, poor patient prognosis as well as tumor resistance therapy. It was found that hypoxia (low O2 levels) is a common character in many types of solid tumors. As an adaptive response to hypoxic stress, hypoxic tumor cells activate several survival pathways to carry out their essential biological processes in different ways compared with normal cells. Recent advances in cancer biology at the cellular and molecular levels highlighted the HIF-1$\alpha$ pathway as a crucial survival pathway for which novel strategies of cancer therapy could be developed. However, targeting the HIF-1$\alpha$ pathway has been a challenging but promising progresses have been made in the past twenty years. This review summarizes the role and regulation of the HIF-1$\alpha$ in cancer, and recent therapeutic approaches targeting this important pathway.},

@misc{McKeown2014,
abstract = {Tumour hypoxia is increasingly recognized as a major deleterious factor in cancer therapies, as it compromises treatment and drives malignant progression. This review seeks to clarify the oxygen levels that are pertinent to this issue. It is argued that normoxia (20\% oxygen) is an extremely poor comparator for "physoxia", i.e. the much lower levels of oxygen universally found in normal tissues, which averages about 5\% oxygen, and ranges from about 3\% to 7.4\%. Importantly, it should be recognized that the median oxygenation in untreated tumours is significantly much lower, falling between approximately 0.3\% and 4.2\% oxygen, with most tumours exhibiting median oxygen levels <2\%. This is partially dependent on the tissue of origin, and it is notable that many prostate and pancreatic tumours are profoundly hypoxic. In addition, therapy can induce even further, often unrecognized, changes in tumour oxygenation that may vary longitudinally, increasing or decreasing during treatment in ways that are not always predictable. Studies that fail to take cognizance of the actual physiological levels of oxygen in tissues (approximately 5\%) and tumours (approximately 1\%) may fail to identify the real circumstances driving tumour response to treatment and/or malignant progression. This can be of particular importance in genetic studies in vitro when comparison to human tumours is required.},

abstract = {Human cancer cells typically harbour multiple chromosomal aberrations, nucleotide substitutions and epigenetic modifications that drive malignant transformation. The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) pilot project aims to assess the value of large-scale multi-dimensional analysis of these molecular characteristics in human cancer and to provide the data rapidly to the research community. Here we report the interim integrative analysis of DNA copy number, gene expression and DNA methylation aberrations in 206 glioblastomas - the most common type of adult brain cancer - and nucleotide sequence aberrations in 91 of the 206 glioblastomas. This analysis provides new insights into the roles of ERBB2, NF1 and TP53, uncovers frequent mutations of the phosphatidylinositol-3- OH kinase regulatory subunit gene PIK3R1, and provides a network view of the pathways altered in the development of glioblastoma. Furthermore, integration of mutation, DNA methylation and clinical treatment data reveals a link between MGMT promoter methylation and a hypermutator phenotype consequent to mismatch repair deficiency in treated glioblastomas, an observation with potential clinical implications. Together, these findings establish the feasibility and power of TCGA, demonstrating that it can rapidly expand knowledge of the molecular basis of cancer. {\textcopyright}2008 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

This is challenging, however, when relevant differences are subtle at the level of individual genes. We introduce an analytical strategy, Gene Set Enrichment Analysis, designed to detect modest but coordinate changes in the expression of groups of functionally related genes. Using this approach, we identify a set of genes involved in oxidative phosphorylation whose expression is coordinately decreased in human diabetic muscle. Expression of these genes is high at sites of insulin-mediated glucose disposal, activated by PGC-1$\alpha$ and correlated with total-body aerobic capacity. Our results associate this gene set with clinically important variation in human metabolism and illustrate the value of pathway relationships in the analysis of genomic profiling experiments.},

abstract = {Diverse genetic, epigenetic, and developmental programs drive glioblastoma, an incurable and poorly understood tumor, but their precise characterization remains challenging. Here, we use an integrative approach spanning single-cell RNA-sequencing of 28 tumors, bulk genetic and expression analysis of 401 specimens from the The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), functional approaches, and single-cell lineage tracing to derive a unified model of cellular states and genetic diversity in glioblastoma. We find that malignant cells in glioblastoma exist in four main cellular states that recapitulate distinct neural cell types, are influenced by the tumor microenvironment, and exhibit plasticity. The relative frequency of cells in each state varies between glioblastoma samples and is influenced by copy number amplifications of the CDK4, EGFR, and PDGFRA loci and by mutations in the NF1 locus, which each favor a defined state. Our work provides a blueprint for glioblastoma, integrating the malignant cell programs, their plasticity, and their modulation by genetic drivers. Single-cell analyses of glioblastoma samples reveal multiple cellular states, their plasticity and the genetic underpinnings of state proportions in a given tumor.},

abstract = {Inhibition of protein synthesis by cycloheximide blocks subsequent division of a mammalian cell, but only if the cell is exposed to the drug before the "restriction point" (i.e. within the first several hours after birth). If exposed to cycloheximide after the restriction point, a cell proceeds with DNA synthesis, mitosis and cell division and halts in the next cell cycle. If cycloheximide is later removed from the culture medium, treated cells will return to the division cycle, showing a complex pattern of division times post-treatment, as first measured by Zetterberg and colleagues. We simulate these physiological responses of mammalian cells to transient inhibition of growth, using a set of nonlinear differential equations based on a realistic model of the molecular events underlying progression through the cell cycle. The model relies on our earlier work on the regulation of cyclin-dependent protein kinases during the cell division cycle of yeast. The yeast model is supplemented with equations describing the effects of retinoblastoma protein on cell growth and the synthesis of cyclins A and E, and with a primitive representation of the signaling pathway that controls synthesis of cyclin D. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {A hybrid cellular automaton model is described and used to simulate early tumor growth and examine the roles of host tissue vascular density and tumor metabolism in the ability of a small number of monoclonal transformed cells to develop into an invasive tumor. The model incorporates normal cells, tumor cells, necrotic or empty space, and a random network of native microvessels as components of a cellular automaton state vector. Diffusion of glucose and H+ ions (the latter largely resulting from the tumor's excessive reliance on anaerobic metabolism) to and from the microvessels, and their utilization or production by cells, is modeled through the solution of differential equations. In this way, the cells and microvessels affect the extracellular concentrations of glucose and H+ which, in turn, affect the evolution of the automaton. Simulations of the model demonstrate that: (i) high tumor H+ ion production is favorable for tumor growth and invasion; however for every H+ ion production rate, there exists a range of optimal microvessel densities (leading to a local pH favorable to tumor but not to normal cells) for which growth and invasion is most effective, (ii) at vascular densities below this range, both tumor and normal cells die due to excessively low pH, (iii) for vascular densities above the optimal range the microvessel network is highly efficient at removing acid and therefore the tumor cells lose their advantage over normal cells gained by high local H+ concentration. While significant spatial gradients of glucose formed, no regions of detrimentally poor glucose perfusion (for either cell type) were observed, regardless of microvessel density. Depending on metabolic phenotype, a variety of tumor morphologies similar to those clinically observed were realized in the simulations. Lastly, a sharp transition (analogous to that of the adenoma-carcinoma sequence) between states of initial tumor confinement and efficient invasiveness was observed when H+ production reached a critical value. {\textcopyright} 2001 Academic Press.},

abstract = {Acidosis of the tumor microenvironment leads to cancer invasion, progression and resistance to therapies. We present a biophysical model that describes how tumor cells regulate intracellular and extracellular acidity while they grow in a microenvironment characterized by increasing acidity and hypoxia. The model takes into account the dynamic interplay between glucose and O 2 consumption with lactate and CO 2 production and connects these processes to H + and HCO3- fluxes inside and outside cells. We have validated the model with independent experimental data and used it to investigate how and to which extent tumor cells can survive in adverse micro-environments characterized by acidity and hypoxia. The simulations show a dominance of the H + exchanges in well-oxygenated regions, and of HCO3- exchanges in the inner hypoxic regions where tumor cells are known to acquire malignant phenotypes. The model also includes the activity of the enzyme Carbonic Anhydrase 9 (CA9), a known marker of tumor aggressiveness, and the simulations demonstrate that CA9 acts as a nonlinear pH i equalizer at any O 2 level in cells that grow in acidic extracellular environments.},

It contains rich features for handling complex experimental designs and for information borrowing to overcome the problem of small sample sizes. Over the past decade, limma has been a popular choice for gene discovery through differential expression analyses of microarray and high-throughput PCR data. The package contains particularly strong facilities for reading, normalizing and exploring such data. Recently, the capabilities of limma have been significantly expanded in two important directions. First, the package can now perform both differential expression and differential splicing analyses of RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data. All the downstream analysis tools previously restricted to microarray data are now available for RNA-seq as well. These capabilities allow users to analyse both RNA-seq and microarray data with very similar pipelines. Second, the package is now able to go past the traditional gene-wise expression analyses in a variety of ways, analysing expression profiles in terms of co-regulated sets of genes or in terms of higher-order expression signatures. This provides enhanced possibilities for biological interpretation of gene expression differences. This article reviews the philosophy and design of the limma package, summarizing both new and historical features, with an emphasis on recent enhancements and features that have not been previously described.},

@article{Robertson-Tessi2015,
abstract = {Histopathologic knowledge that extensive heterogeneity exists between and within tumors has been confirmed and deepened recently by molecular studies. However, the impact of tumor heterogeneity on prognosis and treatment remains as poorly understood as ever. Using a hybrid multiscale mathematical model of tumor growth in vascularized tissue, we investigated the selection pressures exerted by spatial and temporal variations in tumor microenvironment and the resulting phenotypic adaptations. A key component of this model is normal and tumor metabolism and its interaction with microenvironmental factors. The metabolic phenotype of tumor cells is plastic, and microenvironmental selection leads to increased tumor glycolysis and decreased pH. Once this phenotype emerges, the tumor dramatically changes its behavior due to acid-mediated invasion, an effect that depends on both variations in the tumor cell phenotypes and their spatial distribution within the tumor. In early stages of growth, tumors are stratified, with the most aggressive cells developing within the interior of the tumor. These cells then grow to the edge of the tumor and invade into the normal tissue using acidosis. Simulations suggest that diffusible cytotoxic treatments, such as chemotherapy, may increase the metabolic aggressiveness of a tumor due to drug-mediated selection. Chemotherapy removes the metabolic stratification of the tumor and allows more aggressive cells to grow toward blood vessels and normal tissue. Antiangiogenic therapy also selects for aggressive phenotypes due to degradation of the tumor microenvironment, ultimately resulting in a more invasive tumor. In contrast, pH buffer therapy slows down the development of aggressive tumors, but only if administered when the tumor is still stratified. Overall, findings from this model highlight the risks of cytotoxic and antiangiogenic treatments in the context of tumor heterogeneity resulting from a selection for more aggressive behaviors.},

The advent of [18F]fluorodeoxy-glucose positron emission tomography imaging, coupled with recent findings linking hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF-1$\alpha$) overexpression to aggressive cancers, has rekindled an interest in this aspect of tumor metabolism. These studies explore the role of HIF-1$\alpha$ in human breast cancer lines and its relationship to glycolytic regulation. Here we demonstrate that, under normal oxygen conditions, nonmetastatic cells consume less glucose and express low HIF-1$\alpha$, whereas metastatic cells constitutively express high glycolysis and HIF-1$\alpha$, suggesting that dysregulation of HIF-1$\alpha$ may induce the Warburg effect. This hypothesis was tested by renormalizing HIF-1$\alpha$ levels in renal carcinoma cells, leading to inhibition of aerobic glycolysis. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2005 Neoplasia Press, Inc.

Reanalysis of genomic coordinates of published HREs (hypoxia response elements) revealed six polymorphisms within HRE sites (HRE-SNPs): ABCG2, ACE, CA9, and CP. Due to large heterogeneity of results presentation in scientific literature, we also propose a first step towards reporting standardization of HIF-1$\alpha$-target interactions consisting of ten relevant data types. Suggested minimal checklist for reporting will enable faster development of a complete catalog of HIF-1$\alpha$-TGs, data sharing, bioinformatics analyses, and setting novel more targeted hypotheses. The proposed format for data standardization is not yet complete but presents a baseline for further optimization of the protocol with additional details, for example, regarding the experimental validation.},

The aim of this study was to examine the predictive value of GLUT1, GLUT3, and HIF-1$\alpha$ messenger RNA (mRNA)/protein expression as markers of tumor aggressiveness and prognosis in laryngeal cancer. The level of hypoxia/metabolic marker genes was determined in 106 squamous cell laryngeal cancer (SCC) and 73 noncancerous matched mucosa (NCM) controls using quantitative real-time PCR. The related protein levels were analyzed by Western blot. Positive expression of SLC2A1, SLC2A3, and HIF-1$\alpha$ genes was noted in 83.9, 82.1, and 71.7 % of SCC specimens and in 34.4, 59.4, and 62.5 % of laryngeal cancer samples. Higher levels of mRNA/protein for GLUT1 and HIF-1$\alpha$ were noted in SCC compared to NCM (p < 0.05). SLC2A1 was found to have a positive relationship with grade, tumor front grading (TFG) score, and depth and mode of invasion (p < 0.05). SLC2A3 was related to grade and invasion type (p < 0.05). There were also relationships of HIF-1$\alpha$ with pTNM, TFG scale, invasion depth and mode, tumor recurrences, and overall survival (p < 0.05). In addition, more advanced tumors were found to be more likely to demonstrate positive expression of these proteins. In conclusion, the hypoxia/metabolic markers studied could be used as molecular markers of tumor invasiveness in laryngeal cancer.},

abstract = {Cancer is widely known as a "genetic disease" because almost all cancers involve genomic mutations. However, cancer could also be referred to as a metabolic disease because it mainly depends on glycolysis to produce adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and is frequently accompanied by dysfunctions in the mitochondria, which are the primary organelle required in all eukaryotic cells. Importantly, almost all (99%) mitochondrial proteins are encoded by host nuclear genes. Not only cancer but also aging-related diseases, including neurodegenerative diseases, are associated with a decline in mitochondrial functions. Importantly, the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD +) level decreases with aging. This molecule not only plays important roles in metabolism but also in the DNA repair system. In this article, we review 5′-upstream regions of mitochondrial function-associated genes to discuss the possibility of whether NAD + is involved in transcriptional regulations. If the expression of these genes declines with aging, this may cause mitochondrial dysfunction. In this regard, cancer could be referred to as a "transcriptional disease", and if so, novel therapeutics for cancer will need to be developed.},

Previously, numerous approaches that utilize protein-protein interaction information to enhance pathway analysis yielded superior results compared to conventional methods. Hereby, we present pathfindR, another approach exploiting protein-protein interaction information and the first R package for active-subnetwork-oriented pathway enrichment analyses for class comparison omics experiments. Using the list of genes obtained from an omics experiment comparing two groups of samples, pathfindR identifies active subnetworks in a protein-protein interaction network. It then performs pathway enrichment analyses on these identified subnetworks. To further reduce the complexity, it provides functionality for clustering the resulting pathways. Moreover, through a scoring function, the overall activity of each pathway in each sample can be estimated. We illustrate the capabilities of our pathway analysis method on three gene expression datasets and compare our results with those obtained from three popular pathway analysis tools. The results demonstrate that literature-supported disease-related pathways ranked higher in our approach compared to the others. Moreover, pathfindR identified additional pathways relevant to the conditions that were not identified by other tools, including pathways named after the conditions.},

abstract = {Encephalopathy consequent on perinatal hypoxia-ischemia occurs in 1-3 per 1,000 term births in the UK and frequently leads to serious and tragic consequences that devastate lives and families, with huge financial burdens for society. Although the recent introduction of cooling represents a significant advance, only 40 % survive with normal neurodevelopmental function. There is thus a significant unmet need for novel, safe, and effective therapies to optimize brain protection following brain injury around birth. The Na+/H+ exchanger (NHE) is a membrane protein present in many mammalian cell types. It is involved in regulating intracellular pH and cell volume. NHE1 is the most abundant isoform in the central nervous system and plays a role in cerebral damage after hypoxia-ischemia. Excessive NHE activation during hypoxia-ischemia leads to intracellular Na+ overload, which subsequently promotes Ca2+ entry via reversal of the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger. Increased cytosolic Ca2+ then triggers the neurotoxic cascade. Activation of NHE also leads to rapid normalization of pHi and an alkaline shift in pHi. This rapid recovery of brain intracellular pH has been termed pH paradox as, rather than causing cells to recover, this rapid return to normal and overshoot to alkaline values is deleterious to cell survival. Brain pHi changes are closely involved in the control of cell death after injury: an alkalosis enhances excitability while a mild acidosis has the opposite effect. We have observed a brain alkalosis in 78 babies with neonatal encephalopathy serially studied using phosphorus-31 magnetic resonance spectroscopy during the first year after birth (151 studies throughout the year including 56 studies of 50 infants during the first 2 weeks after birth). An alkaline brain pHi was associated with severely impaired outcome; the degree of brain alkalosis was related to the severity of brain injury on MRI and brain lactate concentration; and a persistence of an alkaline brain pHi was associated with cerebral atrophy on MRI. Experimental animal models of hypoxia-ischemia show that NHE inhibitors are neuroprotective. Here, we review the published data on brain pHi in neonatal encephalopathy and the experimental studies of NHE inhibition and neuroprotection following hypoxia-ischemia. {\textcopyright} 2014 The Author(s).},

Opportunities to apply ML occur in all stages of drug discovery. Examples include target validation, identification of prognostic biomarkers and analysis of digital pathology data in clinical trials. Applications have ranged in context and methodology, with some approaches yielding accurate predictions and insights. The challenges of applying ML lie primarily with the lack of interpretability and repeatability of ML-generated results, which may limit their application. In all areas, systematic and comprehensive high-dimensional data still need to be generated. With ongoing efforts to tackle these issues, as well as increasing awareness of the factors needed to validate ML approaches, the application of ML can promote data-driven decision making and has the potential to speed up the process and reduce failure rates in drug discovery and development.},

abstract = {Transport of lactate, pyruvate, and other monocarboxylates across the sarcolemma of skeletal and cardiac myocytes occurs via passive diffusion and by monocarboxylate transporter (MCT) mediated transport. The flux of lactate and protons through the MCT plays an important role in muscle energy metabolism during rest and exercise and in pH regulation during exercise. The MCT isoforms 1 and 4 are the major isoforms of this transporter in skeletal and cardiac muscle. The current consensus on the mechanism of these transporters, based on experimental measurements of labeled lactate fluxes, is that monocarboxylate-proton symport occurs via a rapid-equilibrium ordered mechanism with proton binding followed by monocarboxylate binding. This study tests ordered and random mechanisms by fitting experimental measurements of tracer exchange fluxes from MCT1 and MCT4 isoforms to theoretical predictions derived using relationships between one-way fluxes and thermodynamic forces. Analysis shows that: 1), the available kinetic data are insufficient to distinguish between a rapid-equilibrium ordered and a rapid-equilibrium random-binding model for MCT4; 2), MCT1 has a higher affinity to lactate than does MCT4; 3), the theoretical conditions for the so-called trans-acceleration phenomenon (e.g., increased tracer efflux from a vesicle caused by increased substrate concentration outside the vesicle) do not necessarily require the rate constant for the lactate and proton bound transporter to reorient across the membrane to be higher than that for the unbound transporter; and finally, 4), based on model analysis, additional experiments are proposed to be able to distinguish between ordered and random-binding mechanisms. {\textcopyright} 2011 by the Biophysical Society.},

abstract = {The discovery of oxygen is considered by some to be the most important scientific discovery of all time-from both physical-chemical/astrophysics and biology/evolution viewpoints. One of the major developments during evolution is the ability to capture dioxygen in the environment and deliver it to each cell in the multicellular, complex mammalian body-on demand, i.e., just in time. Humans use oxygen to extract approximately 2550 calories (10.4 MJ) from food to meet daily energy requirements. This combustion requires about 22 mol of dioxygen per day, or 2.5 × 10 - 4 mol s - 1. This is an average rate of oxygen utilization of 2.5 × 10 - 18 mol cell - 1 s - 1, i.e., 2.5 amol cell - 1 s - 1. Cells have a wide range of oxygen utilization, depending on cell type, function, and biological status. Measured rates of oxygen utilization by mammalian cells in culture range from < 1 to > 350 amol cell - 1 s - 1. There is a loose positive linear correlation of the rate of oxygen consumption by mammalian cells in culture with cell volume and cell protein. The use of oxygen by cells and tissues is an essential aspect of the basic redox biology of cells and tissues. This type of quantitative information is fundamental to investigations in quantitative redox biology, especially redox systems biology. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The pH-sensitive fluorescent indicator 2',7'-bis(carboxyethyl)-5(6)- carboxyfluorescein (BCECF) was used to measure lactate transport in single cardiac myocytes. Addition of lactate externally caused a rapid fall of intracellular pH (pH(i)), which was largely inhibited by 5 mM $\alpha$-cyano-4- hydroxycinnamate (CHC), a specific inhibitor of the lactate carrier. Stilbene disulfonates such as 4,4'-dibenzamidostilbene-2,2'-disulfonate (DBDS) only partially inhibited the response, with inhibition being greater in guinea pig than rat myocytes. The data are consistent with two isoforms of the lactate carrier, one sensitive and one insensitive to DBDS, coexisting within a single myocyte and both having a stoichiometry of 1 lactate:1 proton. The initial rate of pH(i) fall was used to determine carrier kinetics. Rat myocytes had a Michaelis constant (K(m)) for external L-lactate of 2.74 mM and a K(m) for external pyruvate of 0.2 mM. Guinea pig cells had a K(m) for external L-lactate of 2.2 mM. Kinetics of lactate efflux were also evaluated using the rate of pH(i) recovery on removing external lactate. The K(m) and maximal rate values for efflux were both threefold higher than for influx and were related to each other and the transmembrane pH gradient as predicted by the Haldane relationship. It is suggested that under hypoxic conditions, the carrier may be the rate-limiting factor for lactate extrusion.},

However, the interrelation between HIF and cyclin D1 remains unclear. In the present study, we observed the inverse correlation between cyclin D1 and HIF-1 in hypoxia condition. Overexpression of the dominant negative mutant of HIF-1$\alpha$ (DN-HIF) significantly enhanced cyclin D1 expression upon hypoxia or arsenite exposure, suggesting the negative regulation of cyclin D1 by HIF-1. Furthermore, we found that the impairment of HIF-1 increased cyclin D1 expression in A549 pulmonary cancer cells, which in turn promoted G1-S cell cycle transition and cell proliferation. Cyclin D1 expression was increased in s.c. xenograft of DN-HIF stably transfected A549 cells in nude mice compared with that of control cells. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assay revealed that HIF-1 was able to directly bind to the promoter region of cyclin D1, which indicates that the negative regulation of cyclin D1 by HIF-1 is through a direct mechanism. Inhibition of histone deacetylase (HDAC) by pretreatment of cells with trichostatin A or specific knockdown of HDAC7 by its shRNA antagonized the suppression of cyclin D1 by HIF-1, suggesting that HDAC7 is required for HIF-1-mediated cyclin D1 downregulation. Moreover, we found that 5-fluorouracil-triggered apoptosis of DN-HIF-transfected A549 cells was reduced by sicyclin D1 (cyclin D1-specific interference RNA) introduction, suggesting that clinical observation of HIF-1 overexpression-associated chemoresistance might be, at least partially, due to the negative regulation of cyclin D1. {\textcopyright}2010 AACR.},

Here we show that the tumor-associated carbonic anhydrases (CAs) are tightly regulated by this system. Both CA9 and CA12 were strongly induced by hypoxia in a range of tumor cell lines, in renal carcinoma cells that are defective for the von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) tumor suppressor, up-regulation of these CAs is associated with loss of regulation by hypoxia, consistent with the critical function of pVHL in the regulation of HIF-1. Further studies of CA9 defined a HIF-l-dependent hypoxia response element in the minimal promoter and demonstrated that tight regulation by the HIF/pVHL system was reflected in the pattern of CA IX expression within tumors. Generalized up-regulation of CA IX in VHL-associated renal cell carcinoma contrasted with focal perinecrotic expression in a variety of non-VHL-associated tumors, In comparison with vascular endothelial growth factor mRNA, expression of CA IX demonstrated a similar, although more tightly circumscribed, pattern of expression around regions of necrosis and showed substantial although incomplete overlap with activation of the hypoxia marker pimonidazole. These studies define a new class of HIF-1-responsive gene, the activation of which has implications for the understanding of hypoxic tumor metabolism and which may provide endogenous markers for tumor hypoxia.},

abstract = {The von Hippel-Lindau tumour suppressor gene (VHL) targets hypoxia inducible factor (HIF)-$\alpha$ subunits for ubiquitin dependent proteolysis. To better understand the role of this and other putative pathways of gene regulation in VHL function we subjected mRNA from VHL defective renal carcinoma cells and transfectants re-expressing a wild type VHL allele to differential expression profiling, and analysed VHL target genes for oxygen regulated expression. Among a group of newly identified VHL target genes the majority but not all were regulated by oxygen, indicating that whilst dysregulation of the HIF system makes a dominant contribution to alterations in transcription, VHL has other influences on patterns of gene expression. Genes newly defined as targets of the VHL/hypoxia pathway (conditionally downregulated by VHL in normoxic cells) include aminopeptidase A, collagen type V, alpha 1, cyclin G2, DEC1/Stra13, endothelin 1, low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1, MIC2/CD99, and transglutaminase 2. These genes have a variety of functions relevant to tumour biology. However, not all are connected with the promotion of tumour growth, some being pro-apoptotic or growth inhibitory. We postulate that co-ordinate regulation as part of the HIF pathway may explain this paradox, and that evolution of anti-apoptotic pathways may be required for tumour growth under VHL-dysregulation. Our results indicate that it will be necessary to consider the effects of abnormal activity in integral regulatory pathways, as well as the effects of individual genes to understand the role of abnormal patterns of gene expression in cancer.},

In gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA), a score that can combine fold change and P-value together is needed for better gene ranking.Results: We defined a gene significance score $\pi$-value by combining expression fold change and statistical significance (P-value), and explored its statistical properties. When compared to various existing methods, $\pi$-value based approach is more robust in selecting DE genes, with the largest area under curve in its receiver operating characteristic curve. We applied $\pi$-value to GSEA and found it comparable to P-value and t-statistic based methods, with added protection against false discovery in certain situations.

Variation in mitochondrial programs is found to be the major contributor to metabolic heterogeneity. Surprisingly, the expression of both glycolytic and mitochondrial programs strongly correlates with hypoxia in all cell types.

abstract = {Inactivation of the von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) tumor suppressor gene underlies the majority of sporadic clear cell renal cell carcinomas (CCRCCs) and is also responsible for the hereditary VHL cancer syndrome. VHL loss of function results in constitutive stabilization of hypoxia-inducible factors (HIF-1$\alpha$ and HIF-2$\alpha$) due to insufficient proteolysis in the presence of oxygen. This activates multiple genes relevant to tumorigenesis, allowing cells to acquire further mutations and undergo malignant transformation. However, the specific role of each HIF-$\alpha$ subunit in CCRCC tumorigenesis is not yet well understood. The current paradigm supports that in the first stages of CCRCC formation the stabilization of HIF-1$\alpha$ is dominant and this limits proliferation, but later on HIF-2$\alpha$ increases and this induces a more aggressive cell behavior. Understanding how this transition happens is highly relevant, as it may provide novel ways to treat these cancers. Here, we show that VHL inactivation in CCRCC cells results in HIF-1$\alpha$/2$\alpha$-dependent downregulation of HIF-1$\alpha$ mRNA through direct binding of either subunit to a reverse hypoxia-response element in the HIF-1$\alpha$ proximal promoter. This binding activates a series of repressive histone modification marks including histone 3 lysine 27 trimethylation (H3K27me3) to make the changes stable, and if overturned reduces CCRCC cell proliferation due to excessive HIF-1$\alpha$ expression level. Our findings thus help understand how HIF-$\alpha$ subunits influence each other and also reinforce the idea that epigenetic mechanisms are a key step of CCRCC progression. {\textcopyright} 2012 Macmillan Publishers Limited All rights reserved.},

In this review, we performed a critical review to summarize the role of the PI3K pathway in tumor development, recent PI3K inhibitors development based on clinical trials, and the mechanisms of resistance to PI3K inhibition.},

abstract = {There exist many methods for describing the complex relation between changes of gene expression in molecular pathways or gene ontologies under different experimental conditions. Among them, Gene Set Enrichment Analysis seems to be one of the most commonly used (over 10,000 citations). An important parameter, which could affect the final result, is the choice of a metric for the ranking of genes. Applying a default ranking metric may lead to poor results. In this work 28 benchmark data sets were used to evaluate the sensitivity and false positive rate of gene set analysis for 16 different ranking metrics including new proposals. Furthermore, the robustness of the chosen methods to sample size was tested. Using k-means clustering algorithm a group of four metrics with the highest performance in terms of overall sensitivity, overall false positive rate and computational load was established i.e. absolute value of Moderated Welch Test statistic, Minimum Significant Difference, absolute value of Signal-To-Noise ratio and Baumgartner-Weiss-Schindler test statistic. In case of false positive rate estimation, all selected ranking metrics were robust with respect to sample size. In case of sensitivity, the absolute value of Moderated Welch Test statistic and absolute value of Signal-To-Noise ratio gave stable results, while Baumgartner-Weiss-Schindler and Minimum Significant Difference showed better results for larger sample size. Finally, the Gene Set Enrichment Analysis method with all tested ranking metrics was parallelised and implemented in MATLAB, and is available at 
                    https://github.com/ZAEDPolSl/MrGSEA
                    
                  . Choosing a ranking metric in Gene Set Enrichment Analysis has critical impact on results of pathway enrichment analysis. The absolute value of Moderated Welch Test has the best overall sensitivity and Minimum Significant Difference has the best overall specificity of gene set analysis. When the number of non-normally distributed genes is high, using Baumgartner-Weiss-Schindler test statistic gives better outcomes. Also, it finds more enriched pathways than other tested metrics, which may induce new biological discoveries.},

abstract = {Successful adaptation to varying microenvironmental constraints plays a crucial role during carcinogenesis. We develop a hybrid cellular automation approach to investigate the cell-microenvironmental interactions that mediate somatic evolution of cancer cells. This allows investigation of the hypothesis that regions of premalignant lesions develop a substrate-limited environment as proliferation carries cells away from blood vessels which remain separated by the intact basement membrane. We find that selective forces in tumoural regions furthest from the blood supply act to favour cells whose metabolism is best suited to respond to local changes in oxygen, glucose and pH levels. The model predicts three phases of somatic evolution. Initially, cell survival and proliferation is limited due to diminished oxygen levels. This promotes adaptation to a second phase of growth dominated by cells with constitutively up-regulated glycolysis, less reliant on oxygen for ATP production. Increased glycolysis induces acidification of the local environment, limiting proliferation and inducing cell death through necrosis and apoptosis. This promotes a third phase of cellular evolution, with emergence of phenotypes resistant to acid-induced toxicity. This emergent cellular phenotype has a significant proliferative advantage because it will consistently acidify the local environment in a way that is toxic to its competitors but harmless to itself. The model's results suggest this sequence is essential in the transition from self-limited premalignant growth to invasive cancer, and, therefore, that this transition may be delayed or prevented through novel strategies directed towards interrupting the hypoxia-glycolysis-acidosis cycle. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is an important mediator in maintaining cellular energy homeostasis. AMPK is activated in response to a shortage of energy. Once activated, AMPK can promote ATP production and regulate metabolic energy. AMPK is a known target for treating metabolic syndrome and type-2 diabetes; however, recently AMPK is emerging as a possible metabolic tumor suppressor and target for cancer prevention and treatment. Recent epidemiological studies indicate that treatment with metformin, an AMPK activator reduces the incidence of cancer. In this article we review the role of AMPK in regulating inflammation, metabolism, and other regulatory processes with an emphasis on cancer, as well as, discuss the potential for targeting AMPK to treat various types of cancer. Activation of AMPK has been found to oppose tumor progression in several cancer types and offers a promising cancer therapy. This review evaluates the evidence linking AMPK with tumor suppressor function and analyzes the molecular mechanisms involved. AMPK activity opposes tumor development and progression in part by regulating inflammation and metabolism.},

abstract = {Tumors and multicellular tumor spheroids can develop gradients in oxygen concentration, glucose concentration, and extracellular pH as they grow. In order to calculate these gradients and assess their impact on tumor growth, it is necessary to quantify the effect of these variables on tumor cell metabolism and growth. In this work, the oxygen consumption rates, glucose consumption rates, and growth rates of EMT6/Ro mouse mammary tumor cells were measured at a variety of oxygen concentrations, glucose concentrations, and extracellular pH levels. At an extracellular pH of 7.25, the oxygen consumption rate of EMT6/Ro cells increased by nearly a factor of 2 as the glucose concentration was decreased from 5.5 mM to 0.4 mM. This effect of glucose concentration on oxygen consumption rate, however, was slight at an extracellular pH of 6.95 and disappeared completely at an extracellular pH of 6.60. The glucose consumption rate of EMT6/Ro cells increased by roughly 40\% when the oxygen concentration was reduced from 0.21 mM to 0.023 mM and decreased by roughly 60\% when the extracellular pH was decreased from 7.25 to 6.95. The growth rate of EMT6/Ro cells decreased with decreasing oxygen concentration and extracellular pH; however, severe conditions were required to stop cell growth (0.0082 mM oxygen and an extracellular pH of 6.60). Empirical correlations were developed from these data to express EMT6/Ro cell growth rates, oxygen consumption rates, and glucose consumption rates, as functions of oxygen concentration, glucose concentration, and extracellular pH. These empirical correlations make it possible to mathematically model the gradients in oxygen concentration, glucose concentration, and extracellular pH in EMT6/Ro multicellular spheroids by solution of the diffusion/reaction equations. Computations such as these, along with oxygen and pH microelectrode measurements in EMT6/Ro multicellular spheroids, indicated that nutrient concentration and pH levels in the inner regions of spheroids were low enough to cause significant changes in nutrient consumption rates and cell growth rates. However, pH and oxygen concentrations measured or calculated in EMT6/Ro spheroids where quiescent cells have been observed were not low enough to cause the cessation of cell growth, indicating that the observed quiescence must have been due to factors other than acidic pH, oxygen depletion, or glucose depletion. {\textcopyright} 1992 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.

abstract = {Measurements of extracellular pH (pH(e)) in vivo have shown that the microenvironment in tumours is more acidic than in normal tissue. However, both human and animal tumour cells have been shown to have an intracellular pH (pH(i)) on the alkaline side of neutrality (pH 7.1-7.2). This gives rise to a reversed pH gradient between tumours and normal tissue which implies that cells within solid tumours are capable of maintaining their level of pH(i) at physiological levels, despite lower than normal levels of pH(e). In this paper the authors describe a mathematical model that provides a possible explanation for the altered pH gradient observed in tumours. The authors examine the influence of changes in the microenvironment on the activity of several membrane based ion transport systems. Using qualitative analysis the authors show that the pH(i) of tumour cells is less sensitive to external pH than for normal cells, because of their increased reliance on the inefficient glycolytic pathway for energy production. It is shown that under aerobic conditions the lactate-/H+ symporter could be the most active exchanger in the regulation of pH(i) in tumour cells. However, under more hypoxic conditions lactate extrusion is reduced, and so this exchanger has little effect on resting pH(i) in these regions. The authors also consider an extended model which incorporates the transfer of acids from the cytosol into acidic organelles. The model demonstrates that one of the major factors involved in the maintenance of cytosolic pH to physiological levels, despite an acidic extracellular pH in hypoxic areas of tumour tissue (median, 6.9-7.0), is enhanced sequestration of cytosolic protons into acidic cellular vesicles such as endoplasmic reticulum, golgi, endosomes, and lysosomes.},

abstract = {Despite intensive treatments including temozolomide (TMZ) administration, glioblastoma patient prognosis remains dismal and innovative therapeutic strategies are urgently needed. A systems pharmacology approach was undertaken to investigate TMZ pharmacokinetics-pharmacodynamics (PK-PD) incorporating the effect of local pH, tumor spatial configuration and micro-environment. A hybrid mathematical framework was designed coupling ordinary differential equations describing the intracellular reactions, with a spatial cellular automaton to individualize the cells. A differential drug impact on tumor and healthy cells at constant extracellular pH was computationally demonstrated as TMZ-induced DNA damage was larger in tumor cells as compared to normal cells due to less acidic intracellular pH in cancer cells. Optimality of TMZ efficacy defined as maximum difference between damage in tumor and healthy cells was reached for extracellular pH between 6.8 and 7.5. Next, TMZ PK-PD in a solid tumor was demonstrated to highly depend on its spatial configuration as spread cancer cells or fragmented tumors presented higher TMZ-induced damage as compared to compact tumor spheroid. Simulations highlighted that smaller tumors were less acidic than bigger ones allowing for faster TMZ activation and their closer distance to blood capillaries allowed for better drug penetration. For model parameters corresponding to U87 glioma cells, inter-cell variability in TMZ uptake play no role regarding the mean drug-induced damage in the whole cell population whereas this quantity was increased by inter-cell variability in TMZ efflux which was thus a disadvantage in terms of drug resistance. Overall, this study revealed pH as a new potential target to significantly improve TMZ antitumor efficacy.},

abstract = {In many different species, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) constitutes a major checkpoint of anaerobic glycolysis, by catalyzing the reduction of pyruvate into lactate. This enzyme has recently received a great deal of attention since it may constitute a valid therapeutic target for diseases so different as malaria and cancer. In fact, the isoform expressed by Plasmodium falciparum (pfLDH) is a key enzyme for energy generation of malarial parasites. These species mostly depend on anaerobic glycolysis for energy production, since they lack a citric acid cycle for ATP formation. Therefore, inhibitors of pfLDH would potentially cause mortality of P. falciparum and, to this purpose, several small organic molecules have been recently designed and developed with the aim of blocking this new potential antimalarial chemotherapeutic target. Moreover, most invasive tumour phenotypes show a metabolic switch (Warburg effect) from oxidative phosphorylation to an increased anaerobic glycolysis, by promoting an upregulation of the human isoform-5 of lactate dehydrogenase (hLDH-5 or LDH-A), which is normally present in muscles and in the liver. Hence, inhibition of hLDH-5 may constitute an efficient way to interfere with tumour growth and invasiveness. This review provides an overview of the LDH inhibitors that have been developed up to now, an analysis of their possible isoform-selectivity, and their therapeutic potentials.},

   abstract = {In vivo studies of human brain cellular function face challenging ethical and practical difficulties. Animal models are typically used but display distinct cellular differences. One specific example is astrocytes, recently recognized for contribution to neurological diseases and a link to the genetic risk factor apolipoprotein E (APOE). Current astrocytic in vitro models are questioned for lack of biological characterization. Here, we report human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived astroglia (NES-Astro) developed under defined conditions through long-term neuroepithelial-like stem (ltNES) cells. We characterized NES-Astro and astrocytic models from primary sources, astrocytoma (CCF-STTG1), and hiPSCs through transcriptomics, proteomics, glutamate uptake, inflammatory competence, calcium signaling response, and APOE secretion. Finally, we assess modulation of astrocyte biology using APOE-annotated compounds, confirming hits of the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway in adult and hiPSC-derived astrocytes. Our data show large diversity among astrocytic models and emphasize a cellular context when studying astrocyte biology. Human studies can typically not be used to understand cellular functions of the brain. Astrocytes, important for neuronal circuit regulation and support, lack cellular model characterization and biological translation. Falk, Herland, and colleagues report striking differences in astrocyte models. A pilot screen of Alzheimer's disease-related drugs demonstrates dependence between compound hit finding and astrocytic model biology.},

Reaching these ambitious objectives will require the development of efficient tools for the detection of molecular defects at the individual level. Here, we propose a novel method, PenDA, to perform Personalized Differential Analysis at the scale of a single sample. PenDA is based on the local ordering of gene expressions within individual cases and infers the deregulation status of genes in a sample of interest compared to a reference dataset. Based on realistic simulations of RNA-seq data of tumors, we showed that PenDA outcompetes existing approaches with very high specificity and sensitivity and is robust to normalization effects. Applying the method to lung cancer cohorts, we observed that deregulated genes in tumors exhibit a cancer-type-specific commitment towards up- or down-regulation. Based on the individual information of deregulation given by PenDA, we were able to define two new molecular histologies for lung adenocarcinoma cancers strongly correlated to survival. In particular, we identified 37 biomarkers whose up-regulation lead to bad prognosis and that we validated on two independent cohorts. PenDA provides a robust, generic tool to extract personalized deregulation patterns that can then be used for the discovery of therapeutic targets and for personalized diagnosis.

It is an integrated database consisting of three generic categories of systems information, genomic information and chemical information, and an additional human-specific category of health information. KEGG pathway maps, BRITE hierarchies and KEGG modules have been developed as generic molecular networks with KEGG Orthology nodes of functional orthologs so that KEGG pathway mapping and other procedures can be applied to any cellular organism. Unfortunately, however, this generic approach was inadequate for knowledge representation in the health information category, where variations of human genomes, especially disease-related variations, had to be considered. Thus, we have introduced a new approach where human gene variants are explicitly incorporated into what we call 'network variants' in the recently released KEGG NETWORK database. This allows accumulation of knowledge about disease-related perturbed molecular networks caused not only by gene variants, but also by viruses and other pathogens, environmental factors and drugs. We expect that KEGG NETWORK will become another reference knowledge base for the basic understanding of disease mechanisms and practical use in clinical sequencing and drug development.},

   abstract = {Oxygenation of tumors and the effect of hypoxia on cancer cell metabolism is a widely studied subject. Hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF), the main actor in the cell response to hypoxia, represents a potential target in cancer therapy. HIF is involved in many biological processes such as cell proliferation, survival, apoptosis, angiogenesis, iron metabolism, and glucose metabolism. This protein regulates the expressions of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and pyruvate dehydro-genase (PDH), both essential for the conversion of pyruvate to be used in aerobic and anaerobic pathways. HIF upregulates LDH, increasing the conversion of pyruvate into lactate which leads to higher secretion of lactic acid by the cell and reduced pH in the microenvironment. HIF indirectly downregulates PDH, decreasing the conversion of pyruvate into acetyl coenzyme A, which leads to reduced usage of the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle in aerobic pathways. Upreg-ulation of HIF may promote the use of anaerobic pathways for energy production even in normal extracellular oxygen conditions. Higher use of glycolysis even in normal oxygen conditions is called the Warburg effect. In this paper, we focus on HIF variations during tumor growth and study, through a mathematical model, its impact on the two metabolic key genes PDH and LDH, to investigate its role in the emergence of the Warburg effect. Mathematical equations describing the enzyme regulation pathways were solved for each cell of the tumor represented in an agent-based model to best capture the spatio-temporal oxygen variations during tumor development caused by cell consumption and reduced diffusion inside the tumor. Simulation results show that reduced HIF degradation in nor-moxia can induce higher lactic acid production. The emergence of the Warburg effect appears after the first period of hypoxia before oxygen conditions return to a normal level. The results also show that targeting the upregulation of LDH and the downregulation of PDH could be relevant in therapy.

abstract = {OBJECTIVE Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most malignant primary brain tumor. Collagen is present in low amounts in normal brain, but in GBMs, collagen gene expression is reportedly upregulated. However, to the authors' knowledge, direct visualization of collagen architecture has not been reported. The authors sought to perform the first direct visualization of GBM collagen architecture, identify clinically relevant collagen signatures, and link them to differential patient survival. METHODS Second-harmonic generation microscopy was used to detect collagen in a GBM patient tissue microarray. Focal and invasive GBM mouse xenografts were stained with Picrosirius red. Quantitation of collagen fibers was performed using custom software. Multivariate survival analysis was done to determine if collagen is a survival marker for patients. RESULTS In focal xenografts, collagen was observed at tumor brain boundaries. For invasive xenografts, collagen was intercalated with tumor cells. Quantitative analysis showed significant differences in collagen fibers for focal and invasive xenografts. The authors also found that GBM patients with more organized collagen had a longer median survival than those with less organized collagen. CONCLUSIONS Collagen architecture can be directly visualized and is different in focal versus invasive GBMs. The authors also demonstrate that collagen signature is associated with patient survival. These findings suggest that there are collagen differences in focal versus invasive GBMs and that collagen is a survival marker for GBM.},

Phase-contrast microscopy studies of the entire GBM system show that invasiveness at early times is limited by available collagen fibers. At early times, high collagen concentration correlates with more effective invasion. Conversely, high collagen concentration correlates with inhibition in the growth of the central portion of GBM, the multicellular tumor spheroid. Analysis of confocal reflectance images of the collagen matrices quantifies how the collagen matrices differ as a function of concentration. Studying invasion on the length scale of individual invading cells with a combination of confocal and coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering microscopy reveals that the invasive GBM cells rely heavily on cell-matrix interactions during invasion and remodeling. {\textcopyright} 2005 by the Biophysical Society.},

Tumors that are engineered using biomaterials are more physiologically relevant than a two-dimensional (2D) cell culture system. Matrix metalloproteinases and the plasminogen activator generated by tumor cells regulate a tumor's invasive behavior. In this study, microtumors were fabricated by encapsulating U87 glioma cells in Type I collagen and then glioma cell migration in the collagen hydrogels was investigated. Crosslinking of collagen with 8S-StarPEG increased the hydrogel viscosity and reduced the tumor cell migration speed in the hydrogels. The higher migration speed corresponded to the increased gene expression of MMP-2, MMP-9, urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA), and tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) in glioma cells grown in non-crosslinked collagen hydrogels. Inhibitors of these molecules hindered U87 and A172 cell migration in collagen hydrogels. Aprotinin and tranexamic acid did not inhibit U87 and A172 migration on the culture dish.

abstract = {Background: Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM, WHO grade IV) is the most common and most malignant of astrocytic brain tumors, and is associated with rapid invasion into neighboring tissue. In other tumor types it is well established that such invasion involves a complex interaction between tumor cells and locally produced extracellular matrix. In GBMs, surprisingly little is known about the associated matrix components, in particular the fibrillar proteins such as collagens that are known to play a key role in the invasion of other tumor types. Methodology/Principal Findings: In this study we have used both the Masson's trichrome staining and a high resolution multiple immunofluorescence labeling method to demonstrate that intratumoral fibrillar collagens are an integral part of the extracellular matrix in a subset of GBMs. Correlated with this collagen deposition we observed high level expression of the collagen-binding receptor Endo180 (CD280) in the tumor cells. Further, interrogation of multiple expression array datasets identified Endo180 as one of the most highly upregulated transcripts in grade IV GBMs compared to grade III gliomas. Using promoter analysis studies we show that this increased expression is, in part, mediated via TGF-$\beta$ signaling. Functionally, we demonstrate that Endo180 serves as the major collagen internalization receptor in GBM cell lines and provide the first evidence that this activity is critical for the invasion of GBM cells through fibrillar collagen matrices. Conclusions/Significance: This study demonstrates, for the first time, that fibrillar collagens are extensively deposited in GBMs and that the collagen internalization receptor Endo180 is both highly expressed in these tumors and that it serves to mediate the invasion of tumor cells through collagen-containing matrices. Together these data provide important insights into the mechanism of GBM invasion and identify Endo180 as a potential target to limit matrix turnover by glioma cells and thereby restrict tumor progression. {\textcopyright} 2010 Huijbers et al.},

abstract = {Glioblastoma is a highly vascularized brain tumor, and antiangiogenic therapy improves its progression-free survival. However, current antiangiogenic therapy induces serious adverse effects including neuronal cytotoxicity and tumor invasiveness and resistance to therapy. Although it has been suggested that the physical microenvironment has a key role in tumor angiogenesis and progression, the mechanism by which physical properties of extracellular matrix control tumor angiogenesis and glioblastoma progression is not completely understood. Herein we show that physical compaction (the process in which cells gather and pack together and cause associated changes in cell shape and size) of human glioblastoma cell lines U87MG, U251, and LN229 induces expression of collagen types IV and VI and the collagen crosslinking enzyme lysyl oxidase and up-regulates in vitro expression of the angiogenic factor vascular endothelial growth factor. The lysyl oxidase inhibitor $\beta$-aminopropionitrile disrupts collagen structure in the tumor and inhibits tumor angiogenesis and glioblastoma multiforme growth in a mouse orthotopic brain tumor model. Similarly, d-penicillamine, which inhibits lysyl oxidase enzymatic activity by depleting intracerebral copper, also exhibits antiangiogenic effects on brain tumor growth in mice. These findings suggest that tumor microenvironment controlled by collagen structure is important in tumor angiogenesis and brain tumor progression. {\textcopyright} 2013 American Society for Investigative Pathology.},

abstract = {Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) tumors, which arise from glia in the central nervous system (CNS), are one of the most deadly forms of human cancer with a median survival time of ∼1 year. Their high infiltrative capacity makes them extremely difficult to treat, and even with aggressive multimodal clinical therapies, outcomes are dismal. To improve understanding of cell migration in these tumors, three-dimensional (3D) multicomponent composite hydrogels consisting of collagen and hyaluronic acid, or hyaluronan (HA), were developed. Collagen is a component of blood vessels known to be associated with GBM migration; whereas, HA is one of the major components of the native brain extracellular matrix (ECM). We characterized hydrogel microstructural features and utilized these materials to investigate patient tumor-derived, single cell morphology, spreading, and migration in 3D culture. GBM morphology was influenced by collagen type with cells adopting a rounded morphology in collagen-IV versus a spindle-shaped morphology in collagen-I/III. GBM spreading and migration were inversely dependent on HA concentration; with higher concentrations promoting little or no migration. Further, noncancerous astrocytes primarily displayed rounded morphologies at lower concentrations of HA; in contrast to the spindle-shaped (spread) morphologies of GBMs. These results suggest that GBM behaviors are sensitive to ECM mimetic materials in 3D and that these composite hydrogels could be used to develop 3D brain mimetic models for studying migration processes. {\textcopyright} 2013 American Chemical Society.},

abstract = {Glioblastoma (GBM) still carries a poor prognosis due to the refractoriness against antitumor drugs. Temozolomide (TMZ), one of the few standard therapy drugs against GBM worldwide, has only limited effect due to acquired TMZ resistance of GBM. Therefore, development of novel therapeutic methods to overcome the TMZ resistance of GBM is urgent. The brain is the most cholesterol-rich organ in the human body, so modulation of cholesterol in tumor cells originating from the brain including GBM may be a tumor-specific therapeutic strategy including enhancement of TMZ effects. The unique lipid metabolism of glioma has recently been reported, but the involvement of intracellular cholesterol in TMZ therapy is yet to be fully elucidated. This review summarizes the effect of modulation of intracellular cholesterol level on cancer therapy including GBM treatment and the implications for TMZ therapy. Our recent findings about the involvement of intracellular cholesterol in TMZ-induced GBM cell death are described.},

abstract = {Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most common malignant primary brain tumor and is invariably fatal to affected patients. Oxysterols belong to a class of bioactive lipids that are implicated in neurological disease and are associated with various types of cancer. Here, we investigated expression and transcriptional regulation of cholesterol 25-hydroxylase (CH25H) in human U87MG and GM133 glioblastoma cell lines. We demonstrate that in both cell lines transcription and translation of CH25H are increased in response to TNF$\alpha$ and IL1$\beta$. In parallel, both cell lines upregulate 25-hydroxycholesterol (25-OHC) synthesis and secretion to levels comparable to bone marrow-derived mouse macrophages under inflammatory conditions. To determine whether 25-OHC acts as chemoattractant for tumor-associated macrophages, the human THP-1 monoblastic leukemia cell line was treated with varying amounts of the oxysterol. Experiments revealed that 25-OHC and lipid extracts isolated from GM133-conditioned medium (containing 7-fold higher 25-OHC concentrations than U87MG medium) induce chemotactic migration of THP-1 cells. Of note, 25-OHC also induced the migration of primary human peripheral blood monocytes. In response to exogenously added 25-OHC, THP-1 cells reorganized intermediate filament-associated vimentin to more cortical and polarized structures. Chemotactic migration of monocytes in response to 25-OHC was pertussis toxin-sensitive, indicating the involvement of G protein-coupled receptors. Using RNA interference we demonstrated that G protein-coupled receptor 183 (EBI2) contributes to 25-OHC-mediated chemotactic migration of THP-1 cells. These in vitro data indicate that GBM-derived and secreted 25-OHC may be involved in the recruitment of immune-competent cells to a tumor via EBI2. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common type of adult malignant brain tumor, but its molecular mechanisms are not well understood. In addition, the knowledge of the disease-associated expression and function of YTHDF2 remains very limited. Here, we show that YTHDF2 overexpression clinically correlates with poor glioma patient prognosis. EGFR that is constitutively activated in the majority of GBM causes YTHDF2 overexpression through the EGFR/SRC/ERK pathway. EGFR/SRC/ERK signaling phosphorylates YTHDF2 serine39 and threonine381, thereby stabilizes YTHDF2 protein. YTHDF2 is required for GBM cell proliferation, invasion, and tumorigenesis. YTHDF2 facilitates m6A-dependent mRNA decay of LXRA and HIVEP2, which impacts the glioma patient survival. YTHDF2 promotes tumorigenesis of GBM cells, largely through the downregulation of LXR$\alpha$ and HIVEP2. Furthermore, YTHDF2 inhibits LXR$\alpha$-dependent cholesterol homeostasis in GBM cells. Together, our findings extend the landscape of EGFR downstream circuit, uncover the function of YTHDF2 in GBM tumorigenesis, and highlight an essential role of RNA m6A methylation in cholesterol homeostasis.},

abstract = {Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common primary brain tumor. Genetic mutations may reprogram the metabolism of neoplastic cells. Particularly, alterations in cholesterol and fatty acid biosynthetic pathways may favor biomass synthesis and resistance to therapy. Therefore, compounds that interfere with those pathways, such as phytol (PHY) and retinol (RET), may be appropriate for cytotoxic approaches. We tested the effect of PHY or RET on the viability of human GBM cell lines (U87MG, A172 and T98G). Since the compounds showed a dose-dependent cytotoxic effect, additional analyses were performed with IC 50 values. Transcriptome analyses of A172 cells treated with PHY IC 50 or RET IC 50 revealed down-regulated genes involved in cholesterol and/or fatty acid biosynthetic pathways. Thus, we investigated the expression of proteins required for cholesterol and/or fatty acid synthesis after treating all lineages with PHY IC 50 or RET IC 50 and comparing them with controls. Sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1 (SREBP-1) expression was reduced by PHY in U87 and T98G cells. However, fatty acid synthase (FAS) protein expression, which is regulated by SREBP-1, was down-regulated in all lineages after both treatments. Moreover, farnesyl-diphosphate farnesyltransferase (FDFT1) levels, a protein associated with cholesterol synthesis, were reduced in all lineages by PHY and in U87MG and A172 cells by RET. Our results suggest that SREBP-1, FAS and FDFT1 are potential target(s) for future in vivo approaches against GBM and support the use of inhibitors of their synthesis, including PHY and RET, for such approaches.},

abstract = {Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most aggressive malignant brain tumor known with a poor survival rate despite current advances in the field of cancer. Additional research into the pathophysiology of GBM is urgently needed given the devastating nature of this disease. Recent studies have revealed the unique cellular physiology of GBM cells as compared with healthy astrocytes. Intriguingly, GBM cells are incapable of de novo cholesterol synthesis via the mevalonate pathway. Thus, the survival of GBM cells depends on cholesterol uptake via low-density lipoprotein receptors (LDLRs) in the form of apolipoprotein-E-containing lipoproteins and ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1) that efflux surplus cholesterol out of cells. Liver X receptors regulate intracellular cholesterol levels in neurons and healthy astrocytes through changes in the expression of LDLR and ABCA1 in response to cholesterol and its derivatives. In GBM cells, due to the dysregulation of this surveillance pathway, there is an accumulation of intracellular cholesterol. Furthermore, intracellular cholesterol regulates temozolomide-induced cell death in glioblastoma cells via accumulation and activation of death receptor 5 in plasma membrane lipid rafts. The mevalonate pathway and autophagy flux are also fundamentally related with implications for cell health and death. Thus, via cholesterol metabolism, the mevalonate pathway may be a crucial player in the pathogenesis and treatment of GBM where our current understanding is still lacking. Targeting cholesterol metabolism in GBM may hold promise as a novel adjunctive clinical therapy for this devastating cancer.},

Here, we show that itraconazole inhibits the proliferation of glioblastoma cells both in vitro and in vivo. Notably, we demonstrate that treatment with itraconazole induces autophagic progression in glioblastoma cells, while blockage of autophagy markedly reverses the antiproliferative activities of itraconazole, suggesting an antitumor effect of autophagy in response to itraconazole treatment. Functional studies revealed that itraconazole retarded the trafficking of cholesterol from late endosomes and lysosomes to the plasma membrane by reducing the levels of SCP2, resulting in repression of AKT1-MTOR signaling, induction of autophagy, and finally inhibition of cell proliferation. Together, our studies provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms regarding the antitumor activities of itraconazole, and may further assist both the pharmacological investigation and rational use of itraconazole in potential clinical applications. {\textcopyright} 2014 Landes Bioscience.},

To find new therapeutic targets for glioblastoma, we looked for pathways that are inhibited by high cell density in astrocytes but not in glioma cells. Here we report that glioma cells have disabled the normal controls on cholesterol synthesis. At high cell density, astrocytes turn off cholesterol synthesis genes and have low cholesterol levels, but glioma cells keep this pathway on and maintain high cholesterol. Correspondingly, cholesterol pathway upregulation is associated with poor prognosis in glioblastoma patients. Densely-plated glioma cells increase oxygen consumption, aerobic glycolysis, and the pentose phosphate pathway to synthesize cholesterol, resulting in a decrease in reactive oxygen species, TCA cycle intermediates, and ATP. This constitutive cholesterol synthesis is controlled by the cell cycle, as it can be turned off by cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors and it correlates with disabled cell cycle control though loss of p53 and RB. Finally, glioma cells, but not astrocytes, are sensitive to cholesterol synthesis inhibition downstream of the mevalonate pathway, suggesting that specifically targeting cholesterol synthesis might be an effective treatment for glioblastoma.},

abstract = {Temozolomide (TMZ) is the first-line treatment for Glioblastoma Multiforme (GBM). After administration, TMZ is rapidly converted into its active metabolite (MTIC). However, its pharmacological activity is reduced due MTIC low bioavailability in the brain. Since drugs' permeability through biological barriers and tumor cell membranes affects its bioavailability, the ability of MTIC to interact with the biological membranes presents a major contribution on its pharmacological properties and activity. Biomembrane models mimic the physiological conditions, allowing to predict the drug's behavior at biological membranes and its effects on drug biodistribution profiles. In this work, lipid bilayer models using liposomes were applied for the drug-membrane interaction studies. The zwitterionic phospholipid, 1,2-dimyristoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DMPC), and cholesterol were chosen for the composition of the model, since they represent the major components of the membranes of GBM cells and brain capillary endothelial cell. Thus, the molecular interactions between MTIC and these models were studied by the evaluation of the partition of the drug into the phospholipid's membrane, its location within the bilayer and its effect on the fluidity of the membrane. The attained results suggest that the composition of membranes affects drugs partition, showing that drug biodistribution depends not only on its physicochemical features, but also depends on the characteristics of the membrane such as the packing of the lipid molecules. Also, MTIC exhibited low affinity to biological membranes, explaining its low bioavailability on the target cells.},

abstract = {Glioblastoma is the most common malignant primary brain tumour in adults and one of the most lethal of all cancers. Growing evidence suggests that human tumours undergo abnormal lipid metabolism, characterised by an alteration in the mechanisms that regulate cholesterol homeostasis. We have investigated the effect that different antitumoural alkylphospholipids (APLs) exert upon cholesterol metabolism in the U-87 MG glioblastoma cell line. APLs altered cholesterol homeostasis by interfering with its transport from the plasma membrane to the endoplasmic reticulum(ER), thus hindering its esterification. At the same time they stimulated the synthesis of cholesterol from radiolabelled acetate and its internalisation from low-density lipoproteins (LDLs), inducing both 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase (HMGCR) and LDL receptor (LDLR) genes. Fluorescent microscopy revealed that these effects promoted the accumulation of intracellular cholesterol. Filipin staining demonstrated that this accumulation was not confined to the late endosome/lysosome (LE/LY) compartment since it did not colocalise with LAMP2 lysosomal marker. Furthermore, APLs inhibited cell growth, producing arrest at the G2/M phase. We also used transmission electron microscopy (TEM) to investigate ultrastructural alterations induced by APLs and found an abundant presence of autophagic vesicles and autolysosomes in treated cells, indicating the induction of autophagy. Thus our findings clearly demonstrate that antitumoural APLs interfere with the proliferation of the glioblastoma cell line via a complex mechanism involving cholesterol metabolism, cell-cycle arrest or autophagy. Knowledge of the interrelationship between these processes is fundamental to our understanding of tumoural response and may facilitate the development of novel therapeutics to improve treatment of glioblastoma and other types of cancer. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

More than 90{\%} of glioblastomas are isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH)-wildtype tumors. Incidence increases with age, males are more often affected. Beyond rare instances of genetic predisposition and irradiation exposure, there are no known glioblastoma risk factors. Surgery as safely feasible followed by involved-field radiotherapy plus concomitant and maintenance temozolomide chemotherapy define the standard of care since 2005. Except for prolonged progression-free, but not overall survival afforded by the vascular endothelial growth factor antibody, bevacizumab, no pharmacological intervention has been demonstrated to alter the course of disease. Specifically, targeting cellular pathways frequently altered in glioblastoma, such as the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (AKT)/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), the p53 and the retinoblastoma (RB) pathways, or epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene amplification or mutation, have failed to improve outcome, likely because of redundant compensatory mechanisms, insufficient target coverage related in part to the blood brain barrier, or poor tolerability and safety. Yet, uncommon glioblastoma subsets may exhibit specific vulnerabilities amenable to targeted interventions, including, but not limited to: high tumor mutational burden, BRAF mutation, neurotrophic tryrosine receptor kinase (NTRK) or fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) gene fusions, and MET gene amplification or fusions. There is increasing interest in targeting not only the tumor cells, but also the microenvironment, including blood vessels, the monocyte/macrophage/microglia compartment, or T cells. Improved clinical trial designs using pharmacodynamic endpoints in enriched patient populations will be required to develop better treatments for glioblastoma.},

We hypothesized that if treatment with a drug could reverse, at least in part, the gene expression signature of GBM and GSCs, this drug may have the potential to inhibit pathways essential in the formation of GBM and thereby treat GBM. Here, we collected 356 GBM gene signatures from public databases and queried the Connectivity Map. We systematically evaluated the in vitro antitumor effects of 79 drugs in GBM cell lines. Of the drugs screened, thioridazine was selected for further characterization because it has potent anti-GBM and anti-GSCs properties. When investigating the mechanisms underlying the cytocidal effects of thioridazine, we found that thioridazine induces autophagy in GBM cell lines, and upregulates AMPK activity. Moreover, LC3-II was upregulated in U87MG sphere cells treated with thioridazine. In addition, thioridazine suppressed GBM tumorigenesis and induced autophagy in vivo.
